# BadL-Exclosure
Rcode for first year of data collection in BadL
This Code and Readme is written by myself in R using the packages ggplot, reshape, ggthemes
The data was gathered and entered in a team effort.


1. Basic Plots to show of the work we did
  1.1 Plot about overall sampled individuals per species
  1.2 Plot about sampled species per climate treatment
  1.3 ! Plot about sampled species per climate and exclosure treatment !

2. Boxplots about size differences 
  2.1 !! Size differences between climate treatments per species !!
    2.11 including t.test to see significant difference
  2.2 Size differences between climate and treatment per species
    2.12 anova

3. Comparison size flower output.

!   Problem with y axis not beeing continues ! -> solved, the values were factors and not numeric
!!  Problem with "?" in the data and therefore non numeric values in the leaf sizes !!
